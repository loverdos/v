This is to replace the old 'v' script, which mixed code and data in one
flat file (very bad idea....) and is now completely unsupported.

Place .metaview??? files in your home directory.
Until proper documentation comes up, I believe that the straighforward
appearance of .metaview??? files will help you understand their use!

Note that the script needs a version of grep that understands the -P 
switch (Perl-compatible regular expressions)


I am developing this thing under Linux.
